    This policy is a replacement for the Kubernetes Pod Security Policy that
    controls the usage of `hostPath` volumes. The policy inspects both the
    containers and the init containers that are using `hostPath` volumes.
    `allowedHostPaths` is a list of host paths that are allowed to be used by
    hostPath volumes. An empty `allowedHostPaths` list means there is no
    restriction on host paths used. Each entry of `allowedHostPaths` must have:
    a `pathPrefix` field, which allows hostPath volumes to mount a path that
    begins with an allowed prefix, and a `readOnly` field indicating it must be
    mounted read-only.
  tooltip: A list of host paths that are allowed to be used by hostPath volumes.
