    This policy works by defining what proc mount types are allowed in
    containers. They can be empty (defaulted by Kubernetes), `Default` or
    `Unmasked`. This policy protects against pods that contain at least one
    container with the `Unmasked` proc mount type, that can potentially expose
    host information to the container.
  tooltip: >-
    Allows the containers, init containers, or ephemeral containers within a pod
    to set `.spec.securityContext.procMount` to Unmasked. Otherwise, the pod or
    the ephemeral request subresource request will be rejected.
