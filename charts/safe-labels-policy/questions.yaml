    This policy validates the labels of generic Kubernetes objects. It rejects
    all the resources that use one or more labels on the deny list. It also
    allows you to put constraints on specific labels. The constraints are
    expressed as regular expression. It will also allow you to require specific
    labels to be part of the resource.
