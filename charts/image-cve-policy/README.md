# Kubewarden policy image-cve-policy

> **WARNING**: This policy is currently in the sandbox phase.
> This means that it is not yet ready for production use.
> The policy is under active development and may change significantly.

## Description

This policy is used to enforce a maximum number of vulnerabilities of a certain severity level in an image.

The policy can be configured to allow a certain number of vulnerabilities of a certain severity level.
When the threshold is exceeded, the image is not allowed to be deployed.

Additionally, the policy supports CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score-based validation,
allowing you to enforce limits based on the actual risk score of vulnerabilities (e.g., allow at most
5 vulnerabilities with CVSS score >= 7.0).

It's possible to provide a list of CVEs that are always allowed or denied, regardless of their severity level.

The policy supports advanced CVE name matching criteria to filter vulnerabilities based on their names using various matching rules.

By default the policy will deny the usage of images that have not been scanned for vulnerabilities.
This behavior can be changed by setting `ignoreMissingVulnerabilityReport` to `true`.

## Deployment Requirements

### SBOMScanner

This policy relies on the [SBOMScanner](https://github.com/kubewarden/sbomscanner) project
being installed in the cluster.

**Warning:** the policy currently supports SBOMScanner version 0.7.0 or later.

This project scans images for vulnerabilities and stores the results in a custom resource
called `VulnerabilityReport`.

### RBAC rules for Policy Server

The Policy Server that runs this policy must have the `GET`, `LIST` and `WATCH` privileges
over the `VulnerabilityReport` resource.

This can be achieved by creating the following RBAC resources:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: sbomscanner-vulnerability-reports-viewer
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - storage.sbomscanner.kubewarden.io
    resources:
      - vulnerabilityreports
    verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: sbomscanner-vulnerabilility-reports-viewer-policy-server
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: sbomscanner-vulnerability-reports-viewer
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: policy-server
    namespace: kubewarden
```

**Warning:** the binding above grants access only to the ServiceAccount named `policy-server` that
is defined inside of the `kubewarden` namespace.

### Configuration

This is a [context aware policy](https://docs.kubewarden.io/reference/spec/context-aware-policies),
hence it must be deployed as a `ClusterAdmissionPolicy` and it must be granted access to the
`VulnerabilityReport` resources.

The `VulnerabilityReport` resources are namespaced, hence the configuration of the policy must
include the namespace where the `VulnerabilityReport` resources have been created.

## Policy Evaluation Time

Currently, this policy is a bit slower compared to the other Kubewarden policies. This is caused
by the lookup of `VulnerabilityReport` resources. This can be visible when the cache used by
the Policy Server is cold.

Because of that, it's recommended to raise the [policy evaluation timeout](https://docs.kubewarden.io/reference/policy-evaluation-timeout)
value.

Starting with Kubewarden 1.29.0, this value can be configured on a
[per policy basis](https://docs.kubewarden.io/reference/policy-evaluation-timeout#per-policy).

It's recommended to set this value to 10 seconds:

```yaml
apiVersion: policies.kubewarden.io/v1
kind: ClusterAdmissionPolicy
metadata:
  name: image-cves
spec:
  module: registry://ghcr.io/kubewarden/policies/image-cve-policy:latest
  timeoutEvalSeconds: 10
```

## Settings

This policy can be configured using the following settings:

```yaml
maxSeverity:
  critical: # total and totalWithoutFixes are mutually exclusive
    total: 10 # maximum number of critical CVEs that are allowed
    totalWithoutFixes: 5 # max number of critical CVEs without fixes that are allowed
  high: # total and totalWithoutFixes are mutually exclusive
    total: 20 # maximum number of high CVEs that are allowed
    totalWithoutFixes: 10 # max number of high CVEs without fixes that are allowed
  medium: # total and totalWithoutFixes are mutually exclusive
    total: 30 # maximum number of medium CVEs that are allowed
    totalWithoutFixes: 15 # max number of medium CVEs without fixes that are allowed
  low: # total and totalWithoutFixes are mutually exclusive
    total: 40 # maximum number of low CVEs that are allowed
    totalWithoutFixes: 20 # max number of low CVEs without fixes that are allowed
  unknown: # total and totalWithoutFixes are mutually exclusive
    total: 40 # maximum number of unknown CVEs that are allowed
    totalWithoutFixes: 20 # max number of unknown CVEs without fixes that are allowed

# List of CVEs that are always allowed, they do not count towards the
# max_cve_severity

# List of CVEs that are always denied, they do not count towards the
# max_cve_severity
denyAlways:
  - CVE-2020-1234
  - CVE-2020-5678

# What to do if the image has not been scanned for CVEs
# Setting to true will accept the image, setting to false will reject the image
# Default is false

# Ignore data produced applying VEX profiles.

#
# It's recommended to use the default value to avoid false positives.
ignoreVexStatus: true | false

# CVSS scores are checked independently from severity-based checks. Both checks are applied
#
# CVSS score priority: nvd > redhat > ghsa > bitnami > other sources
cvssScore:

```

## CVE Name Matching Rules

The `cveName` setting allows you to filter vulnerabilities based on their CVE names using various matching criteria.

**Available matching modes:**
- `containsAnyOf`: enforces that the resource has at least one of the CVE names in `values`.
- `doesNotContainAnyOf`: enforces that the resource does not have any CVE name defined in `values` (denylist).
- `containsAllOf`: enforces that all of the CVE names in `values` are defined in the resource.
- `doesNotContainAllOf`: enforces that the CVE names defined in `values` are not all set together in the resource.
- `ContainsOtherThan`: enforces that the resource contains at least one CVE name not in `values`.
- `DoesNotContainOtherThan`: enforces that the resource contains only CVE names from `values` (allowlist).

**Note:** Only one matching mode can be specified at a time. The matching is case-sensitive and uses exact CVE name matching.

## Examples

The following policy is running in monitor mode and has strict criteria for critical
and high vulnerabilities. Paired with Kubewarden's
[Audit Scanner](https://docs.kubewarden.io/explanations/audit-scanner/policy-reports),
this policy provides a way to find the vulnerable workloads that are running inside of
your cluster.
